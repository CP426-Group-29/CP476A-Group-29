# CP476A - Project - Group 29

Course project for CP476A. This repo holds the planning and code for a
ticket/booking system.

# Project Description:

Teams, small businesses, and student groups often lack a simple and centralized system to manage internal issues, tasks, and support requests.
As a result, they frequently rely on:

Email threads that become difficult to track and manage

Spreadsheets that do not support notifications or workflow management

Messaging platforms (such as Slack or Discord) where requests are easily lost in conversations

Physical boards that are not accessible to remote members

This leads to lost requests, unclear ownership, poor prioritization, and limited visibility into progress.

The Help Desk / Ticketing System aims to provide a lightweight, web-based solution for submitting, tracking, and managing requests in one centralized platform.
